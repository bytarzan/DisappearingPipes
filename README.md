# DisappearingPipes
This game is a modified version of flappy bird that you can play with on desktop platforms! 
My version of this game has pipes that disappear right before the koopa troopa passes through the space between the two pipes. 

How to Play:

Dependencies 
LWJGL 3.3.0 - Used Light Weight Java Game Library 3, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.lwjgl.org/customize). Once the files are downloaded, you need to add the jar and native files manually in order for the game to run.
