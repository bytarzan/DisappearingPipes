# DisappearingPipes
This game is a modified version of flappy bird that you can play with on desktop platforms!  <br />
My version of this game has pipes that disappear right before the koopa troopa passes through the space between the two pipes. 

How to Play: <br />
Here is the layout of the game before the game begins. <br />

Press the spacebar each time you want the koopa troopa to go through the two pipes!  <br />
Make sure to stay attentive as the bars disappear right before the koopatroopa can pass through.
